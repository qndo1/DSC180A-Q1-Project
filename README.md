## Datasets

### SFU MOCAP data
run 
```
    script.py
```
This should download one of the mocap files and show the optimal transport matching between the first frame and the 500th frame. We've set the download and conversion limits as being 1, but feel free to remove those limits in script.py to download and convert the entire dataset.
